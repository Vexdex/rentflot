<h2>Briefly about the terminology and advantages:</h2>
<p><strong>Banquet </strong> (fr. Banquet - bench) - gala dinner. Guests are seated at beautifully decorated and covered banquet tables (in more detail in Wikipedia)</p>
<p><strong>Fourchette</strong> (from the French. Fourchette - ork) - sharing food, when invited to eat standing up, freely choosing food and drinks, serving themselves, using a fork exclusively (more detail on Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The main advantage of a buffet is that guests have the opportunity to move freely around the hall and communicate with their colleagues and friends. It is also a good choice for small sites, since it is possible to accommodate on its territory much larger number of visitors than in seating arrangements. At the cocktail party, as a rule, is a line of tables, nicely decorated with dishes, drinks and dishes for them. In the hall arranged tables for an aperitif (can be of different heights and shapes). Buffet menu, as opposed to the banquet, more diverse and also includes canapés, snacks, fruits and desserts.</p>
