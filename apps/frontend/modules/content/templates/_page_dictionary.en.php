<p><strong>Cook &mdash;</strong> a person who prepares food on the ship.</p>
<p><strong>Dam &mdash;</strong> a barrier constructed across a waterway to control the flow or raise the level of water.</p>
<p><strong>Deck &mdash;</strong> wooden or metal flooring on vessels. There are such types of deck: upper deck, main deck, accommodation deck, awning deck, sun deck.</p>
<p><strong>Deckhouse &mdash;</strong> (1) An enclosed structure on a ship’s main deck or on superstructures that does not extend to the sides. Living quarters and administrative and duty rooms, usually arranged in several tiers, are located in the deckhouse. (2) A separate duty room on a ship, which, depending on its purpose, is known variously as the pilothouse, chart house, conning tower (on naval warships), or radio room.</p>
<p><strong>Displacement &mdash;</strong> the weight or volume of a fluid displaced by a floating body, used especially as a measurement of the weight or bulk of ships.</p>
<p><strong>Draught &mdash;</strong> the depth of a vessel's keel below the water surface.</p>
<p><strong>Fairway &mdash;</strong> a channel for vessels that, by virtue of sufficient depth and lack of obstacles, allows safe navigation across some expanse of water, such as a river, lake, sea, strait, or fjord. Fairways are marked by navigation aids, for example, buoys and leading marks.</p>
<p><strong>Galley &mdash;</strong> the kitchen of a ship, boat.</p>
<p><strong>Gang-plank &mdash;</strong> a ladder or board or ramp used as a removable footway between a ship and a pier for boarding and leaving the ship. On vessels all kinds of ladder, wherever they are and whatever construction they have, are called gang-planks. They can be used on ships with high board and cargo vessels for leaving the vessel when at the pier or at a mooring place.</p>
<p><strong>Halyard &mdash;</strong> a rope used to raise or lower a sail, flag, or yard.</p>
<p><strong>Keel &mdash;</strong> the principal structural member of a ship, running lengthwise along the center line from bow to stern, to which the frames are attached.</p>

<p><strong>Mooring line &mdash;</strong> a rope or cable used for securing a ship to a pier or wharf.</p>
<p><strong>Pier &mdash;</strong> located perpendicular to the shoreline (or at the angle close to 90°) double-sided mooring place, that makes it possible to carry out loading and unloading works on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>Pivoting pressure &mdash;</strong> the vessel pressure to the setting assembly. P.p. occurs at the stem of the downhill slide when stern floats during the descent. The value of P.p. is determined by the difference of weight force of the vessel and the water force reaction that occurs during stern floating.</p>
<p><strong>Porthole &mdash;</strong> a small, usually circular window in a ship's side.</p>
<p><strong>Ravine &mdash;</strong> relatively low, steep-sided, usually concave bank of the river.</p>
<p><strong>Shalanda &mdash;</strong> an unpowered large flatbottom boat of metal or wood, used chiefly for transporting cargo.</p>
